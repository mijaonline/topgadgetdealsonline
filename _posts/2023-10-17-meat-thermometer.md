## Instant Reading with High Precision

The ImSaferell Meat Thermometer provides instant and highly accurate temperature readings for your meat. Its ultra-thin probe, with a diameter of 1.6mm, slides easily into your meat, giving you precise readings within 2-3 seconds. The accuracy is an impressive +/-1°F, and it can measure temperatures ranging from -58℉ to 572℉ (-50℃ to 300℃). Say goodbye to guesswork when grilling or cooking.

## Large LED Display with Backlight

This meat thermometer features a large LED display with a convenient backlight. You can effortlessly read the measurements, even in bright outdoor light. The warm light not only makes reading easy but also reduces eye fatigue. Whether you're cooking during the day or night, this feature ensures you get the right readings.

## IPX7 Waterproof Grill Thermometer

Clean-up is a breeze with the ImSaferell Meat Thermometer. Its IPX7 waterproof rating allows you to wash it under running water after use. The probe thermometer can be stored by attaching it to any metal surface thanks to the built-in magnets or hanging it on a hook using the hanging hole. Just remember not to soak the thermometer in water for extended periods.

## Safe Long Probe, “Hold” Function

Safety is a top priority with this kitchen gadget. The probe extends to 4.6 inches, keeping your hands and heat sources at a safe distance. After you've removed it from the meat, the "Hold" function displays the temperature for your convenience. Plus, there's a handy bottle cap opener, making it a versatile tool for any kitchen.
